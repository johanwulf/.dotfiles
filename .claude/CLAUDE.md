Check for the existence of the file .github/copilot-instructions.md in each git project for context on the project, read this file before doing changes

Use context7 MCP when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation

When creating git commits, don't add any body, and don't add yourself as co-author

Do not add ANY comments to the code, very important!
